PoC Testframework

When running visual studio it is reccomended to install the Specflow extension. 

The framework has no CI implementation yet.
To run the tests you can use the (unit)test explorer. 
The tests will be grouped per feature file, per feature file there will be a test for each scenario listed. 
When a new test is added you will need to build the solution before the new test becomes visible in the testexplorer.
